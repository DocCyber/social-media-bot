AI Response: Sounds like a wild ride! The things you hear from students can be quite the adventure. Who knew teaching came with such unexpected job offers?

User Reply: I was teaching a sixth grade science class about symbiotic relationships. Simple concept with really big words! So they zoned out. Exasperated I asked, “If I got up on the table and danced a jig would you guys listen to me for the rest of the period?”
AI Response: That sounds like a fun way to keep them engaged! Sometimes a little creativity is what it takes to bring those big words to life for the kids. Keep up the great work!
