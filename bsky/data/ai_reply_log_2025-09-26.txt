User Reply: I don't know how teachers manage to name their children these days. It's bad enough having worked with students & young adults, but when your working life has been thousands of kids it must be impossible. 

I think I'd resort to Klingon (says the guy who named his cat "Animal" ).
AI Response: Naming a kid in a world full of unique names is definitely a puzzle! Klingon might just be the way to go for originality. Your cat named Animal sounds like quite the character!
