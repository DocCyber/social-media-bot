They're so full of themselves.
User Reply: As usual I'll repay you with one of my own 😀

Winning a multi-million dollar lottery can be truly wife-changing.

😆
AI Response: Nice one. Though I suspect that's less about the lottery and more about finally being able to afford the therapy bills.

Original Post: A way to determine if you are old?

Fall over in front of people.

If they laugh, you're still young.

If they panic and help you up... you're old!
User Reply: All it took for me to have strangers holding me up was stubbing my toe and catching my step. Apparently they are more aware of my age than I am.
AI Response: That's the real test - when strangers start treating you like you might shatter. The toe stub assessment is pretty solid though.
