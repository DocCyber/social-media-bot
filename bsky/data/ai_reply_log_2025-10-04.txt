User Reply: Finally learned a term for an issue I have. It was created in 1979, had it for 50 years and only know it know. Without going into details it's a behavioural issue born out of OCD, yet I don't have OCD anymore. It's really good to know things better now.
AI Response: It's great that you've found clarity with this term. Understanding ourselves better is always a win. If it helps, that's what matters most. Keep exploring and learning :)
