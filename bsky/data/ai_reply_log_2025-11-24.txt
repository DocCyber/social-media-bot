User Reply: There are still ATM'S that only charge $2?  Where?!  Usually its $3.50 or 4, 5 or more at airports, event venues, etc.!  As much as I love my own bank, no fees on their ATM'S, if I use a "foreign" ATM, not only do I pay that bank's fee, my own bank whacks me for another $3.5!
AI Response: Right? It's like they want to make sure you're triple-tapped for using cash. Those fees stack up quick, especially when your bank joins in on the takedown. Time to go cashless or find a fee-free haven!
