It's been very exciting! The Blue Jays are a talented, fun, hard-working team with great team spirit, so they're easy to like and get behind. 

I hope they win for themselves/Toronto and Canada, but also cos' it'll piss off a bunch of people.🍊💩
AI Response: Exactly! The Jays definitely know how to bring that energy. The idea of them winning and ruffling a few feathers along the way is just an added bonus. Let's keep cheering them on!

I love Toronto, truly, but as a Montrealer, I'm conflicted agreeing with your first statement. 🤣

Now, your second statement, on the other hand, is absolutely correct! 👍❤️
