User Reply: I finally got to see run the next leg of Winter of Atom in Fallout 2d20

We’ve been playing for over a year but scheduling issues mean my monthly game happens every 3 months if we’re lucky

Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, which is important
AI Response: That sounds like a blast! Getting everyone's schedules to line up is a quest in itself. Happy to hear it's working out and everyone's enjoying the game. Keep those stories rolling!

I bought a cheap 32" Fire TV for my S-I-L after her old TV died. OMG, it's a pain in the ass. It requires weekly software updates and still crashes like early Windows. I've had to teach her how to find the reboot menu option, and at least once it locked up so bad it needed unplugging.
AI Response: Sounds like modern tech in a nutshell! It's wild how even TVs need a reboot these days. Almost feels like we're tech support for our own stuff 24/7. Hope your S-I-L's TV behaves itself!
