Procrastination!

When do we want it?

There's no rush...
User Reply: Yeah, until then I was lackluster in my support of the antiwar movement -- kind of hit or miss; but Kent State was a crystalizing moment for me.  From then on I was out doing door-to-door canvassing, getting petitions signed, marching on the state capitol building, etc.

User Reply: It's also very funny. Because people tend to think in their own boxes, thinking out-of-the-box is not taught very often.
I'm not working in games, but I do use simple games in meetings, to get attention and make them more entertaining. Of course, a lot of people say, “A waste of time”, it's not
AI Response: I love that you use games to shake things up in meetings. It's a creative approach that can really break the monotony and spark some fresh ideas. People often underestimate the power of a little fun in the workplace. Keep doing your thing!
