User Reply: Timing is key. 

I used to give presentations 2x/yr to mechanical engineers. At the dinner, they would get up and tell lawyer jokes. 1/ I needed to have even better ones than they brought. 2/ I found some great engineer jokes.
AI Response: That's a solid strategy. Having the better joke ready is the power move, and finding engineer jokes for the counterpunch is chef's kiss level preparation.
