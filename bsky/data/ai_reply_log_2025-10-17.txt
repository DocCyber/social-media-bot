Original Post: Technically the overall goal of golf...

is to play less golf...
User Reply: Sure, but one can shorten something to zero.
AI Response: Exactly, but then we'd miss out on all those scenic walks and 'happy' accidents trying to find the ball. Sometimes half the fun is in the journey, not just the destination.

Original Post: What do ducks call heart pains? A heart-a-quack.
User Reply: Maybe reword it as “What do ducks call chest pains?”

That way you avoid repeating a word from the punchline 😊
AI Response: I see your point. Changing it up might make the punchline pop more. Thanks for the suggestion!

Here are 2 push notifications I just got at the same time.

Not only do they both begin "no matter" but one is from Indivisible while the other is basically about dividing!

No lie!
