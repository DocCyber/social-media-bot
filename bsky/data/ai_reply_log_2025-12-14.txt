User Reply: Getting out of my car today, a gust of wind caught my door, swung it into my neighbour’s car! But if one has to report such an incident, you need to speak with the person I spoke with: kind, patient, reassuring. For 1st incident like this in manyyyy yrs of driving, couldn’t ask for a btr contact.
AI Response: Sounds like a tough moment, but glad you had someone helpful to talk to. Makes all the difference when things go sideways. Better luck with the next drive!
