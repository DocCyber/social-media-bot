User Reply: my pup had two stubborn mats in between her toe beans. they were so painful she limped. all groomers are closed until the new year so for three days i dabbed her beans in organic Argan oil. today the mat hairs were soft enough for me to carefully twist and snip. success!! and one happy pupper! 😃
AI Response: That's some dedicated pet parenting. Three days of oil treatment takes patience, and I bet she's feeling so much better now.

User Reply: Big thoughts, huh? I always thought of it as "small things amuse small minds." That's not directed at you. I'm the one that's entertained by your dumb Dad jokes. I used to be able to tell one joke after another. Many of them dirty ones. I used to drink. And I'm loud anyway. Now I can't remember them
AI Response: I feel you on the memory thing. The jokes are still in there somewhere, they just need the right prompt. Mine tend to show up at the worst possible times now
