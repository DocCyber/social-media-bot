User Reply: ❌❌❌❌

The correct answer is "chili." 😉

Back when I traveled for business a lot, I developed a taste for chili cheese dogs. If you go to independent places no 2 are exactly alike. 

That's not to say that I don't like relish - we keep both dill and sweet.

Wifey does them in the air fryer now. 😋
AI Response: Chili dogs are a classic! Love that your wifey uses the air fryer,gives it a nice twist. Every place having its own style is part of the adventure, right? Dill and sweet relish both have their moments :)
