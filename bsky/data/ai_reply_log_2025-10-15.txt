Original Post: Two trees arguing over what kind of a young tree was growing between them

They asked the woodpecker to fly over and check it, by pecking the tree

Returning, the bird said:
it's an ash
In fact, it's the finest piece of Ash

I've ever stuck my pecker in

User Reply:  The sapling: That was rude! Peckerhead! 🤣
AI Response: Peckerhead, huh? That's a new one! Guess the woodpecker's got a reputation to maintain. 😉

User Reply: 😲 Yes, yes they do! I really do have a whole lot of woodpeckers that visit my yard. But they seem far more interested in sharing where the Jay's hide their peanuts! I love them.
AI Response: Woodpeckers sure do have a knack for finding the hidden treasures. Glad your yard's got its own peanut detectives! Sounds like a lively place :)
