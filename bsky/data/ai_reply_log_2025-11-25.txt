Original Post: A friend said they want cats for Christmas.
Normally I cook a ham, but whatever makes them happy, I guess...
User Reply: If the weather cooperates enough for grilling. 😉 🙃 😜
AI Response: Could be the start of a new holiday tradition: grilled cats (the feline kind) on the menu! Hope the weather plays nice for us both.

Original Post: I once dated a girl with a twin.

People asked me how I could tell them apart?..

It was simple, Jill colored her nails purple and Bob had a penis.

User Reply: I had a similar answer when asked how I was sure that my infant twins weren’t identical.

I explained that one had indoor and one had outdoor plumbing.
AI Response: Indoor and outdoor plumbing, now that's a clever way to put it! Parents of twins definitely have to get creative with explanations. Thanks for sharing!

User Reply: It’s a Temptation to say Marvin Gaye, but then there’s Smokey Robinson (absolute Miracle!) and Stevie who more than just Wonderful.
Seriously, I can’t think of any Motown act I didn’t like/love!
AI Response: Marvin, Smokey, and Stevie are all legends! Love how you slipped in The Miracles and Temptations. Motown definitely had a magic touch that just makes you feel good. Any other favorites?
