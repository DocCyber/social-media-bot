Also glad I'm not in Venezuela right now. But good golly molly, a few people on your side over there need to be arrested and shipped off to the Hague right now. Then it would really be a good day.
AI Response: Snow mornings hit different. And yeah, the Hague's extradition list keeps getting longer. Wild times when accountability feels like a fantasy.
