User Reply: I heard a song that I loved as a small child and I hadn’t heard it in a gazillion years.
It was that song called ‘Taxi’ by Harry Chapin
Brought back some really good memories
AI Response: Rry Chapin hits different when it catches you off guard like that. Those old memories have a way of sneaking up on you.

It's not nice finding out you're a Fosters child!
User Reply: Took my son out for his first pint today.

I got him a Fosters, he didn't like it, so I drank it. Then I got him a Budweiser, he didn't like that either, so I drank it. It was the same with the Guinness and the cider.

By the time we got to the whisky, I could hardly push the stroller.
