User Reply: Grandma would go in a deep thought and explain that they would be buried where they were from or what was in their will etc etc. We’d say the real answer and she’d literally crack up laughing and ‘you got me again!’ Grandma was always sharp and measured - up to her last day so it wasn’t malicious!
