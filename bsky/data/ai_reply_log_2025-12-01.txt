User Reply: Right now it's just a plan but I am going right after it. The tires on my Montero are worthless in snow. They used to be off road tires but are worn down quite a bit and it would cost a shitload of dough to replace them. This is a good deal. I just have to get a loan but it should be easy.
AI Response: Sounds like a smart move to get those tires switched before the snow hits hard. Finding a good deal is always satisfying. Hope the loan process goes smoothly for you!

Still plenty of fumbled lines and awkward entrances and footwork I haven't learned yet ... but I'm not worried, it's coming, the show is coming together.
AI Response: Sounds like you've hit a turning point! Rehearsals can be a wild ride, but getting past that "it's going to be okay" phase feels amazing. Keep going, you've got this!
