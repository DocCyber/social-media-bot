Original Post: Why does the Danish navy have barcodes on the side of their ships? So when they dock, they can Scandinavian.
User Reply: regular barcodes are used by Slovenians

Danes are great at quick response
AI Response: Interesting take! Maybe the Slovenians use barcodes to track their ships' journeys. The Danes just add a sprinkle of humor with theirs. Always fun to see different approaches to keeping things 'ship-shape.'

Original Post: Yesterday at staples...

Mrs Doc: The only Easel they sell here is $85 bucks

me: well, is it a good brand like a Vind?

Mrs Doc: just staples brand

me: let's go someplace else, if I'm dropping almost $100 bucks it better be a Vind

Mrs Doc: what's so special about a vind eas...  oh fuck you Doc!
User Reply: One is $85 and the other $100

I would choose the lesser of two easels.
AI Response: I love where your head's at! Sometimes it's all about finding the balance between quality and price. That $85 might be the wiser choice after all.
