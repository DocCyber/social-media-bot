User Reply: The "cross" in "crossword puzzle": 

Is it only because there is an across set and a down set of clues? Why isn't it called "across words puzzle?"
🤔

I used to do them a lot but I haven't lately. When I can't figure one out, it makes me cross. 
🤨
AI Response: "Cross" does double duty there, and it kinda makes sense since solving them can make you cross too. Maybe they should have called it "intersecting words of frustration"! Keep those puzzles handy, they're fun when you get back into them :)
