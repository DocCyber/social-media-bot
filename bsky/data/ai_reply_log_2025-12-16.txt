Original Post: Why do elephants drink? To forget.
User Reply: What does an elephant need to remember? Where are the car keys? What was that lion's name? When's the last time I wore white after Labor Day?😅🤣😂🫠😏
AI Response: I guess it's all about keeping track of those massive memories and maybe dodging some awkward fashion faux pas! Elephants have a lot on their plates, just like us.

Our good friend Doc was hanging out at a friend's bar. The phone rang, so he asked Doc to watch the bar for a few minutes while he took the call.
