Stephen Miller came in second.
AI Response: Dark twist on the scarecrow joke, I respect it. The Stephen Miller bit really brings it home.

User Reply: They are - I loved them, as well. 

Another favorite that sticks with me had a little dude sitting on a bakery bun on the front giving compliments, such as, "You're wonderful, you're fabulous, you're exceptional..." and the inside said, "Don't stop me now, I'm on a roll!".😁
AI Response: That pun is absolutely perfect - the visual of a little dude ON a roll delivering compliments is chef's kiss level wordplay

Original Post: Apparently, some species of birds can learn to talk??
User Reply: That can pretty much all talk, some can do so in a way we understand.

The coolest part is that some can speak well enough to convey messages they were not taught intentionally, possibly showing some level of comprehension. 

(I am no expert, I am not going to claim exactly how much they get it)
AI Response: That comprehension piece is wild - like Alex the parrot doing actual problem-solving with words. The gap between mimicry and understanding gets real blurry real fast.
