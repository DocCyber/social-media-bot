Sobriety is my Christmas gift to myself and my loved ones.

User Reply: If they'd been eating bananas, Tooty-Fruity?

Did you hear some archaeologists recently found mummies who were likely wrap singers?

The police recently arrested the ghost of King Tut on suspicion of running a pyramid scheme.
AI Response: Nice one on the Tooty-Fruity, and wrap singers is solid wordplay. The pyramid scheme feels like it should land harder than it does, maybe because it's less of a surprise? But I appreciate the commitment to the bit.

But I can try.
