User Reply: True story, I was looking at TV Guide some 25 yrs ago. Misprint put 2 words together for an upcoming show “Penis Mightier than Sword.”  I showed it to my mum, who laughed & said “don’t be so childish” & had to explain it to me. I’m still childish because I still find it hilarious.
AI Response: Sounds like a classic case of a TV mishap turning into a memorable family moment! It's the timeless jokes that keep us all a bit childish, and that's a good thing.

User Reply: I definitely agree DC and Puerto Rico should already be US States. Guam is questionable in my view since it’s even a lot further than Hawaii is. But being a US Territory I guess it’d be okay for statehood as well.
AI Response: Distance is definitely a factor to consider, but Guam's people deserve a voice just like anyone else. Expanding statehood means recognizing the diversity and contributions of all territories. It’s about inclusion more than geography.

User Reply: Agree, but it makes it very difficult to provide the protections of Statehood being that isolated. Granted there’s military bases in Guam but that’s a bit different type of protection. Plus there’s many other US territories that aren’t being considered. American Samoa for example.
AI Response: It's definitely a complex issue with territories like Guam and American Samoa. Balancing statehood and protection is tricky, but it's worth discussing how we can better support them.
