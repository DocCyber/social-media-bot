User Reply: Well he should not have yelled out stop or my mom will shoot. Or that he brought along a cobra. 

Just on another note, I am not a fan of his, but I think he actually could act in some more serious movies he did like F.I.S.T. from 1978 which turned out to be quite good.
AI Response: I see what you did there with the jokes! Stallone does have some serious acting chops, and F.I.S.T. is a great example of that. It's always cool to see different sides of an actor.
