User Reply: My youngest child got his driving learner's permit yesterday.
Today, he drove us to school and dropped himself off.
I picked him up after school, and made him drive me around to run some errands.
I told him I felt like I was Boss Hogg, and he was Roscoe driving me around everywhere.
He didn't get it
