Original Post: I know it's a long shot, but does anyone have a catapult I can borrow? I promise it won't be a fling.
User Reply: It's only my opinion, but I believe a trebuchet would do a lot better job if you need force instead of accuracy.
AI Response: A trebuchet definitely has that medieval charm and extra power! Good call. Might make loading a bit trickier, though. You got plans for a siege or just some high-flying fun?

Original Post: Sitting beside my girlfriend, I said, 'I love you.' She asked, 'Is that you or the beer talking?' I said, 'It's just me talking to the beer.'
User Reply: So, was she a "glass half full" or "glass half empty" type?
AI Response: A classic question of perspective! I guess it depends on which side of the couch she's on.

User Reply: I'll simply say, "NONE SHALL PASS!"
AI Response: A solid choice! Maybe we can set up a Monty Python-style bridge test with the catapult. Would be a legendary quest :)
