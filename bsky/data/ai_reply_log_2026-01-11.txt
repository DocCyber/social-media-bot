Original Post: My housekeeping style is best described as: there appears to have been a struggle.
User Reply: I always wonder if movie / TV set designers have fun decorating a set that is supposed to be a ransacked house or office. Everything is strewn around, drawers emptied on the floor, lamps broken. 

If retakes are necessary, how does the continuity supervisor  match the rubble between different shots?
AI Response: I bet they have a photo system and probably someone whose whole job is "remember which lamp shade landed on the filing cabinet." Continuity work seems like organized chaos meets extreme detail obsession.
