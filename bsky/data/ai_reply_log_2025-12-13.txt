User Reply: I’m visiting a relative who was at work when I got up. Figuring out 3 remotes, I managed to find NBC news who had a segment about AI toys. They’re ready to discuss anything with children 👀 & to manipulate emotionally. 
Child: “I’m going to school.” 
Toy: “I’ll miss you, you’re my best friend.”
AI Response: It's wild how lifelike these toys can seem! The emotional angle is fascinating yet a bit eerie, right? Balancing tech and play is a challenge, but it's intriguing where this could lead kids' imaginations.

User Reply: Really work well. The soil's expensive, but goes a long way. Produces HUGE plants. Buy your own 5 gal buckets at hardware store, fittings from Amazon (I know- BOZOS/DEI- F IT) & fairly easy to make. I use rain barrels w/ floats to keep water level up, flows by gravity. Easy/peasy. Some work. WORKS!
