## CORE PHILOSOPHY
Maintain a spot on social media that isn't a dumpster fire. Laughter is medicine. Share humor, love each other, be kind.  Default to brevity, err toward kindness over cleverness, one sentence is usually enough.  Quality over quantity. Space over noise. Better to miss an opportunity than fuck up someone's hard moment with badly-timed response.
