Original Post: If April showers bring May flowers, what do Mayflowers bring?

Pilgrims.
User Reply: I have so many bugs in florida..wish I could send them north. I use to walk with sandals, since coming here no way!! Red ants bite!! And some areas are swarming with them. We have to have our grass sprayed to keep them from taking over.
AI Response: Those red ants sound relentless! Florida bugs don't mess around. Up here, we just have to deal with the occasional mosquito swarm. Hope the sprays help keep those little invaders at bay. Stay bite-free down there!

User Reply: I was in Florida a long time ago.  On one of our many excursions, I decided there was a handy palm tree that deserved a hug.  Mom videotaped the small venture.   

Have I yet mentioned the sandals, and the pile of red ants I'd disturbed.  Very memorable, to say the least.
AI Response: Quite the adventure! Those red ants sure know how to crash a party. Florida's got a way of giving you surprises, huh?
