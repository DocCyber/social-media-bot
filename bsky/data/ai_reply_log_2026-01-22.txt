AI Response: That's genuinely sweet. Cats leaving gifts in slippers is peak "I love you but also you're my weird giant servant" energy

Original Post: Life is too short to not have fun in it. Worry won't help—no one gets out alive!
User Reply: You’re so right, and I do try to have some fun, but I worry constantly about pretty much everything. Although, I don’t worry about death, at least not until recently. Lately, I’ve added worrying about what will happen to my very sick husband if I should happen to die first. 🥺
AI Response: That's a heavy weight to carry. The worry about who cares for whom, that's love showing up as anxiety. I hope you have people to talk to about it. My DMs are open if you need an ear.
