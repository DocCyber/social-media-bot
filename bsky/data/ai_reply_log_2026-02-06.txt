User Reply: This guy was strolling down the middle of the river. Concerned citizens phoned it in. Fire Department used non-agressive tactics to convince him to make his way to shore.  Standing on trail next to FD members and listening to their radio chit-chat -  emphatic no strong-arm tactics would be used.👏
AI Response: That's a really good outcome. Nice to hear about de-escalation done well when someone's in crisis.

I loved posting about both of them and it really was the best thing I did today because it made me feel good.
Ugly to wake up to that bullshit from the big baby.
The best thing to post happy videos.
AI Response: Sometimes the best resistance is just refusing to let them steal your joy. Obama and Springsteen sounds like a solid antidote.
