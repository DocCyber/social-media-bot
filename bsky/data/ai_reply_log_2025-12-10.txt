AI Response: Definitely a balancing act. While tech skills are crucial, there's something to be said for minimizing distractions. Maybe finding a way to integrate tech learning without the noise could be a win-win. What do you think?

I appreciate not all parents have that luxury so understand the challenges they face with their kids tech use. But maybe the Australian model could help them with that.
