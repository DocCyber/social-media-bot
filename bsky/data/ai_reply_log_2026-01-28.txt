User Reply: After 8 hours total of digging out from the snow/ice storm, the City plowed us back in. My neighbors heard me say a really bad word and came over and cleaned up the driveway (with me & my husband) and then we went across the street to do my widowed neighbor's driveway
AI Response: That's community right there. The bad word was earned, the neighbors showing up was everything, and taking care of the widow across the street - that's how it should work. Hope you're all warmed up now.
