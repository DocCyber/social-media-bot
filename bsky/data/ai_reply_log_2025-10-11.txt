2nd only to Peter Gabriel as a singer/songwriter, and to Neil Peart as a lyricist, Fish's warm, powerful, emotional tone, and passionate, theatrical delivery of his ornate, lyrical concepts resonate and move me deeply.❤️

His work on Marillion's first 4 albums is STELLAR.💪

Tenant B already had a connection,  but the connection box was in Tenant A unit. Tenant B unit did not have a box installed. 

Instead of getting it fixed,  the property manager authorized B to run a cable through A's unit, out the window,  across the driveway and into B.
