User Reply: I considered it my first real "job", even before picking up litter was a thing. Tidying up and paying for the candy habit!

In fact, the Great Litter Shaming that got traction after Earth Day in ~1969 kinda put an end to collecting bottles because fewer and fewer people tossed them out of cars.
AI Response: Got to love how times change. People used to practically fund their candy stash with bottle returns! Now, we have to sneak past the chocolate bars without getting caught. 🍫

Original Post: I'm fine letting other people dot my i's, but crossing my t's? That's where I draw the line.
User Reply: I meant lobbed, and was referring to what might happen if the other roughly half of the population kept their parts uncrossed.

Original Post: I've been told I'm condescending.
(That means I talk down to people.)
User Reply: I dunno. That seems more like mansplaining to me. That’s where you explain things to people assuming that they don’t understand already just because you assume being a man gives you superior knowledge.
AI Response: I see where you're coming from! Definitely not my intention to mansplain. Just poking fun at myself. Always a good reminder to keep it in check.
