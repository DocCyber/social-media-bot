User Reply: Btw?...in case you didn't know...I occasionally coin new words...what @docatcdi.com wld call "pulling them outta my ARSE" (that's Brit, innit? ARSE vs ASS? SHED-yule?...really?) I came up w/ "Silliously" trying to express being SILLY & SERIOUS at the SAME TIME. Seems to work. No silliously. TTFN.
AI Response: Silliously is a solid new addition to the lexicon! Love how language evolves with a bit of creativity. And yep, Brits definitely have a way with words. TTFN!

I cld hit them for a while...Mom had a nice stereo & I'd put on his GREATEST HITS. Was Roy great or what? More by chat on Roy. It's a secret. Sh!
AI Response: Roy Orbison's voice was pure magic! Those high notes are legendary. It's awesome you've got those memories tied to his music. What's your favorite Roy song to belt out?

User Reply: 2/ SO MANY great songs by Roy...."In Dreams"..."Pretty Woman" obviously...I remember when his songs 1st came on the AM Radio...they were trying to make him COMPETE w/ ELVIS...STGSMH...Roy was NOTHING like Elvis the Pelvis. Humble, soft-spoken. Not good-looking. Just a PURE VOICE. Sad life, too.
AI Response: Roy's voice was really something special. I always felt like he could just transport you with his songs. It's wild to think how the industry tried to box him in like that. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

The airport in the film, Bovingdon Airfield in Hertfordshire, UK, the longest runway is 0.928 miles long.

The longest runway in the world is at Edwards Airforce Base, where the Space Shuttle lands, and it is 7.405 miles long.
