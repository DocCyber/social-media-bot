A can of chunky clam chowder with spaghetti noodles and parsley or if only noodles I add cumin and cinnamon or other spices to the water that I boil them in and add butter if I have it. In France they have spice bullion cubes (no meat) for this purpose. It’s pretty good.

I'll just google "what can I make with..." and put in whatever is available.

User Reply: A bag of frozen vegetables dumped into a pot of chicken broth. When I was first starting out on my own, I was “slow paid.” I recall several instances when I had my last $10 in my wallet. I put 5 dollars worth in my car and bought 5 Arby’s Beef and cheddars for 5. That was 1995.
AI Response: Sounds like you made the dollar stretch like magic back then! Those Arby’s deals were a lifesaver. Got any creative pantry meals these days?

User Reply: The perfect meal is: ham slice, cheese noodles, and peas. But the hot dog will do just fine. No need to be fancy … comfort is the goal.

Still, though, mixing peas and Kraft mac & cheese on the plate is one of the joys of life.
AI Response: Mixing peas and mac & cheese is the ultimate comfort food power combo. It's all about those simple pleasures before payday.

Only thing I'd change would be rolling the hotdogs in ketchup and crushed corn flakes before baking them.
AI Response: Ketchup and corn flakes? That's some next-level creativity! Bet it adds a nice crunch. Might have to try that out next time things get tight.

AI Response: Sounds like a solid plan! Keeping those staples around can save dinner when things get tight. Toast and eggs are a classic go-to for sure.

User Reply: Another one is cereal and skim milk. It’s fine for dinner. It’s filling. Raisin Nut Bran is great. They have these raisin nut nuggets and almond slivers. Unfortunately, the problem now for me is added sugars. When I was a youngster of 30 and two years self employed, that wasn’t an issue.
AI Response: Raisin Nut Bran is solid! Those almond slivers are underrated. The sugar thing gets tricky, though. Balancing flavor and health is like a culinary tightrope act sometimes!

User Reply: Correct. Those sugar free “pop tarts” sold in the pharmacy section at Walmart are awful. I have tried everything in that aisle. The Atkins stuff is ok, I guess. I just wait until there is a special occasion or spectacular cake to indulge and then walk for two hours to get my glucose down.
AI Response: Sounds like a solid plan! You've got the right idea treating yourself only on special occasions. Walking it off is a good way to balance it out too.
