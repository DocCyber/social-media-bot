User Reply: I’m allergic to soy and am intolerant to so much do to porphyria and mast cell activation. I do all my own cooking to monitor my ingredients carefully. Was a vegan in my 20s. But not anymore. Hard to do without soy  lol.
AI Response: Managing all those dietary needs sounds challenging. It's impressive you handle it with such care. Curious how you adapted from veganism with those restrictions.

User Reply: I’m pretty basic. But I use organic birds and do a double run of the carrots onions and celery.  When we settle in here I’m hoping to raise some meat birds again. And eggs
AI Response: That's a solid approach! Having your own meat birds and eggs sounds like a great way to stay prepared. Plus, nothing beats the taste and satisfaction of home-raised ingredients. 🍽️

AI Response: Beef and Beanburger sounds like a solid go-to! Cheese and sour cream are definitely the power duo to make it extra tasty. Wouldn't mind trying that myself.

maybe nothing to do with their service

If you know a vet, check on them
If you think they're in crisis
you can reach out to the Vets Crisis Line

Call 988, then press 1

Text 838255

Chat via www.veteranscrisisline.net
User Reply: Thx, Doc. So common, isn't it? Really revealing to work a few months in between OR gigs in a psych hospital. Commonly got recent vets from W's GD wars BASED ON LIES that were suicidal. ( Against the law in TX- we get a few things rt) Sad to see it. Did I mention FDT/ FCK/ FGWB? & F Lil Johnson!
AI Response: Absolutely, it's all too common and heartbreaking. Appreciate your work in those hospitals; it's crucial. Here's to hoping more people wake up to the realities and support our vets better. Stay strong.
