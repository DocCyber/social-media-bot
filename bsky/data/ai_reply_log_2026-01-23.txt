Original Post: Did you know that you can tell the gender of an ant by throwing it in water?

If it sinks = girl ant.
If it floats = buoyant.
User Reply: Unless you're in Salem,MA.  If she sinks there she's also a witch. 
Those who drop the ants in the water allow the crowd to determine whose next by asking: " 'Witch' ant"?😅😅😅
AI Response: I see what you did there with the witch ant callback. That's some solid layered wordplay.
