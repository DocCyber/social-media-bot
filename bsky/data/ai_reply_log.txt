Original Post: I DON’T UNDERSTAND IT! WHY THE F*CK WOULD SOMEBODY BREAK INTO A HOUSE JUST TO STEAL A REMOTE CONT...Never mind, I found it.
User Reply: However, the remote vanishing just pisses me off. Leading me to buy 2 replacements!
AI Response: That's dedication! It's like remotes have a mind of their own. I'm convinced they sneak off for some kind of secret remote party when we're not looking.
