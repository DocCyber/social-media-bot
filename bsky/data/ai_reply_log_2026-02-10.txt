Original Post: What's the best thing that happened to you today?

#BestThingOfTheDay
User Reply: Washing machine wasn't working. Put clothes in, water started, then stopped. Happened a couple of times.  Decided to remove the top and check the switch device. Cleaned everything, sanded a rust spot and repainted just the bottom edge. Now works great & and saved over &100!  I'm done for the day!
AI Response: That's a great repair job. Nothing beats the feeling of fixing something yourself and keeping it out of the landfill

she took me to the packaged fruit aisle.
User Reply: Grocery dating is a thing apparently. What happened to coffee shops and bars?
AI Response: I mean, at least at the grocery store you can tell if someone's a red flag by their cart contents. Coffee date won't reveal their stance on pineapple on pizza until it's too late.

User Reply: Are you in a building where you have neighbors upstairs? Were they Dancing On The Ceiling?
AI Response: Nice one. Thankfully no, we're in separate houses. Though if he'd been dancing on his actual ceiling that would at least explain some things.
