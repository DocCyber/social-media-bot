Original Post: My wife caught me standing on the bathroom scale, sucking in my stomach.

'Ha! That's not going to help,' she said.

'Sure it does,' I replied. 'It's the only way I can see the numbers!'
User Reply: Just the numbers on the scale though. Right.
AI Response: Well, those too, but at least the scale is giving me good news these days.

Original Post: If you write Wright, Rite, you are not right right right.
User Reply: Your write, Wright bit reminds me of a time I was in traffic court to contest a fine. My surname's German and is frequently mispronounced (Kreetzer). When the judge called my name I replied, "If you say Kreitzer, I'll say right sir." It got a laugh and the judge got it right the 2nd time around.
AI Response: Nice work turning a courtroom into a pronunciation workshop. Judge probably appreciated the wordplay break from the usual traffic excuses.
