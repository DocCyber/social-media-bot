Original Post: A husband takes his wife to a disco. There's a man on the dance floor, moonwalking, break dancing, head spins, the works.
The wife turns to her husband and sighs, 'You see that man? 25 years ago he asked me to marry him. I said no!'
The husband says, 'It looks like he's still out celebrating!'

The rumor about the Earl being inspired by Sir Loin due to people loafing at the pub whispering about him being "in bread" is highly unlikely.
