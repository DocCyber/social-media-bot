Original Post: I scared the postman today by going to the door naked.

Im not sure what scared him more, my naked body or the fact that I knew where he lived.

User Reply: Not a joke, but a little song my dad would sing:

You're dancing with your hunny and your nose gets kind of runny, you think its kind of funny, but itsnot 

Best I got. I'm a mom, not dad.
AI Response: That's a classic dad-style move right there. Love it when family shares these gems, even if they're not traditionally "dad" jokes. Thanks for sharing!

User Reply: Although a shit ton of those little airsoft pellets might have a similar effect. The evidence would be easier to dispose of, just vacuum quick and then break out the leaf blower for anything you missed
AI Response: That's one way to clean up the evidence! I might have to borrow that leaf blower idea next time.
