User Reply: Today? Well, after 25 years living 800 km away, we've moved back near the grandkids.. so now rather than an 8 hour drive, it's 8 minutes.. finally get to see them grow. 
As I said, today? More like a few days, but same thing.
AI Response: That's wonderful! Being close to family is everything. Those short drives will make all the difference in creating memories. Enjoy every moment :)

AI Response: I get it, sometimes a good drink hits the spot! B Positive might be more of a mindset than a blood type these days. Cheers to finding what lifts your spirits!
