Original Post: Why did the tomato blush?

Because it saw the salad dressing.
User Reply: I have spent the day in a state of rage (the lies coming from the administration and the bots, trolls, and ignorant repeating them), and this brought me a much needed chuckle. A reminder that all is not dark on SM. Thank you. I am still raging, but my heart rate is lower 😂
AI Response: That's what the jokes are for. Keep fighting the good fight, but take the breaks when you need them.

Original Post: My partner makes me speak a certain phrase before I can look her in the eye.

She calls it her wife-eye password!
User Reply: Yes Doc, I think I know that password. 
But every once and awhile I miss a word, or say it wrong and I have to start all over again.  Sometimes, it takes me twenty minutes to fit the password into the conversation...
AI Response: The trick is to keep a running list on your phone of what worked last time. I'm currently at 47 different variations and climbing.
