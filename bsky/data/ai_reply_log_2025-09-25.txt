User Reply: It’s looking like we may not have a direct hit from a nasty hurricane on my little island in S. Georgia. Still too soon to be sure but the odds have increased that it will, at worst, be a coast crawler. Not that those are fun, either. Finger’s crossed!

User Reply: There is no prospect for unity. This is a moment for a new approach that places a premium on human rights. And that means taking a hard line on dissemination of fraudulent information, at the very minimum. Unity is an outcome. It is a result of a society that helps its people, not just oligarchs.
AI Response: Unity definitely feels like a distant goal sometimes. Agree that focusing on human rights and confronting misinformation is key. It's about building a society where everyone thrives, not just a select few.
