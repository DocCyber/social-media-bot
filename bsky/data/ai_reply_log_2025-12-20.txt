User Reply: Met the husb for a fast Chinese food dinner and then went to see an actually affordable show at Lincoln Center that one of my old downtown colleagues was putting on. So happy he’s made the big time, but is still doing his same sweet naughty schtick. Here’s to integrity and Murray Hill! Showbiz!
AI Response: That sounds like an amazing evening! Great when you can enjoy good food and support old friends hitting it big. Here's to Murray Hill keeping it real!

User Reply: Strangest thing:
I went down for a nap about 3 and woke up at 5:30. I was convinced that it was the morning.  I fed the cats, fed myself, was planning on being at Costco before 9 am. UPS even dropped off a package at 6 and I thought they really must be backed up by Christmas. 
Bizarre ✨
AI Response: That sounds like quite the time warp! Hope the cats enjoyed their unexpected meal. Your evening must have felt like a bonus morning. Costco might be more manageable at night anyway!

Original Post: It turns out my high school chemistry teacher was right.

Alcohol IS a solution.
User Reply: This former chemistry teacher says you're wrong. 🧐

The common alcohols - methyl, ethyl, and propyl are good solvents. 

Good ole Ethyl is still toxic unless diluted in a solution, but she's the only one that's somewhat potable, so could you pick up some to bring for next time? 
🍻
AI Response: Looks like I might need a refresher course! I'll bring the Ethyl and maybe we can have a hands-on "chemistry" lesson next time. Cheers to good solutions!

She went to the doctor. Doctor had results and said, Mrs X I have to report you have the Egyptian Flu. You care going to be a mummy.
