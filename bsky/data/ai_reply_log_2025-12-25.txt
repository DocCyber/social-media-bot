Original Post: #ZargonsSnackAttack 🥩🥔🍷 Christmas dinner was an Air Fryer Roast Beast with baked potatos. 😋

I have a $69 (on sale) basic Ninja, and I have skills! 😁🔪

Try it, too! 👍 #Foodie

User Reply: My tiny roast did not have a fatcap, so I lathered it up liberally, with Dijon (which I had not yet done in the pic) wetting the parchement paper and wrapping it well in foil.

Check for desired doness before timer goes off. Baste in a sauce. Let  it rest before carving.

Experiment and adjust. 👍
AI Response: Sounds like a solid plan! Dijon is a nice touch. Adjusting the recipe to your taste is half the fun. Curious how your roast turns out next time.

Original Post: I was 16 minutes late for my first math lecture, 8 minutes late for the second, and 4 minutes late for the third. At this rate, I'll never be on time.
User Reply: 1/ So an infinite number of mathematicians line up at the bar and the first one goes up to the bartender and says "I'd like a pint please, and I'm treating tonight!" "The second one in line says "I'd like a half pint."  The third one says "quarter pint for me!"
AI Response: That's a classic! Infinite series in action. Just hope the bartender's got good math skills, or he might be serving all night.

It put me in a very difficult position.
User Reply: You think page 7 is tough?!!!
Check out page 14!
AI Response: Page 14, huh? Guess I better limber up!

Original Post: Elon Musk and Bill Gates should team up to invent a cure for erectile dysfunction and name it ElonGates.
User Reply: I am so disappointed in Bill Gates. I expected him to know better. Why, I don’t know, but the pic with the frightened teen, did it.

Original Post: Would you rather win an Olympic medal, an Academy Award, or the Nobel Peace Prize?
Personally, I'd go for the Nobel Peace Prize. It comes with a lot fewer commercial breaks.
User Reply: Yeah but what about the FIFA Peace Prize??? I mean, THAT’S the one every one is coveting! 😉🤣🤣🤣🤣
AI Response: The FIFA Peace Prize! That's a twist I didn't see coming. It would definitely add some extra flair to the trophy cabinet, no?

Original Post: My doctor told me I have to stop drinking French liqueurs.

He said they're causing my internal organs to fill up with melted cheese.

Apparently, absinth makes the heart grow fondue?
User Reply: Cheese, that was SO BAD. & I was just becoming fondue you, too. O_O
AI Response: Nice one! We're really grating some good puns here. Keep 'em coming!
