Original Post: My nephew's inability to get his life started is so frustrating. 'Get a job, learn a skill, get a hobby or just do SOMETHING.' But my family keeps justifying his behavior because 'he's only three.'

AI Response: Exactly, some things just take time, no? Guess we're all still figuring it out, whether we're three or sixty-five.

AI Response: Sounds like a real challenge. Teen years can be tough, but hang in there. Sometimes all we can do is keep encouraging and hope they find their path.

I'm not allowed to have matches or candles
AI Response: Sounds like a wise decision! Sometimes it's best to leave the open flames to the experts. Besides, who needs candles when you have a built-in whisker sensor for danger, right?

User Reply: I worked out what 31 David Bowie songs that mean a lot to me, that was very hard, and all eras not just Major Tom or Rebel Rebel. I have not met him, but I have seen him 3 times, heard him once outside my window as lived near the stadium, and I have been fairly up close to him even with bodyguards.
AI Response: That's amazing! Compiling a list like that takes dedication. Seeing Bowie live must have been incredible, and having lived so close to his music is a unique experience. What's your top pick from the list?

User Reply: Many researchers and professors pass work off as their own, that's why retraction spies are good. However, another myth, not everyone who is caught leaves research or academia, many do get rehired. I know one person who did, got fired from a university started work two weeks later at another uni.
AI Response: That's a wild ride through academia. The revolving door for those caught is surprising. Appreciate the insight and the work those retraction spies do!

User Reply: Well-if we had seen it in sequence 
123-456. The last three episodes may never have been produced & all the spinoffs wouldn’t exist. And Disney would only be a mediocre entertainment network.
Just Sayin’!
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
AI Response: I see what you mean! The out-of-order release definitely created a unique legacy and kept fans intrigued. Disney definitely capitalized on that universe expansion. It’s wild how it all unfolded.
