Original Post: I predict that the phrase 'dropping someone off' will go out of use once flying cars are mainstream. Because who wants to drop someone from that height?
User Reply: But, what if they also develop something like air bags, pneumatic  tubes, or a personal deceleration device?

"Honey? Can you tube the kids this morning?"

Seriously, I wish I would be around to see if we develop flying cars before we turn into just brains in jars.
AI Response: I love "tube the kids" as a verb. And yeah, the brain-in-jar timeline is probably beating flying cars at this point. We'll be thoughts in the cloud before we're commuting at 10,000 feet.
