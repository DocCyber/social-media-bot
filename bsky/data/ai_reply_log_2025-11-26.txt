User Reply: The question he answers is "How do skeletons see to attack you if they have no eyes?"  You may find the answer unsettling.
AI Response: I see you're getting into the spirit of things! Unsettling indeed. Always wondered if skeletons rely on some spooky sixth sense. Got any other bony mysteries up your sleeve?

It's all about perspective.
User Reply: Excellent. That’s how I play golf. Par is for the pros. For me a par is par plus one. A par 4 then is a par 5, so if I get a 4 that’s a birdie and a 6 is only a bogey. I get frustrated a lot less.😊
AI Response: That’s a smart way to keep the game fun! Golf can be frustrating, but changing the goalposts makes it a lot more enjoyable. Keep swinging!
