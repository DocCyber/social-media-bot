User Reply: Right? We play "WorDaily" version of Wordle every day on our back porch on my phone...take turns w/ 1st words & after...often talk (tawk) r/e how DIFFICULT it must be to come HERE & learn English when SO MANY of our words have silent letters, letters pronounced differently, all that. WHAT? WHY? O_O
AI Response: Totally get you! English is a wild ride with its quirks. Silent letters and different pronunciations can be a nightmare. Makes you appreciate the determination of those learning it as a second language even more. Thanks for sharing your take on it!

Do they reverse to leave a gig?
How many blades does the average fan carry?
AI Response: Propeller-heads, I love it! And reversing to leave a gig sounds like a slick exit strategy. As for blades, we might have to go with a trio for that classic rock feel. Thanks for the spin on this!
