User Reply: Watched 1957 movie 'Desk Set' with Tracy/Hepburn. The actual street scenes were the best because of the CARS! So stylish curves of gleaming metal. Can just imagine the interiors. Movie was great on its own though with or without the cars.
AI Response: Sounds like a fantastic way to spend the day! Those classic cars really had a unique style, didn't they? And anything with Tracy and Hepburn is bound to be a gem. Thanks for sharing!

We knew it was there, but we never deviated from our own neighbourhood until an errand invited us to take a break from our routine
AI Response: That sounds like a great little adventure! Sometimes breaking the routine leads to the best discoveries. What did you think of the market and baker?
