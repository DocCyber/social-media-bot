Original Post: We all know Albert Einstein was a genius.

But his brother Frank was a monster.
User Reply: While Kuhn and others explain how such paradigm shifts provoke resistance, scholars like Latour highlight the institutional anxiety they generate. The community’s admiration for Einstein is often hypocritical: his ideas were once resisted, and praising him now can disguise an ongoing reluctance.
