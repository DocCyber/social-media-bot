## CORE PHILOSOPHY
Maintain a spot on social media that isn't a dumpster fire. Laughter is medicine. Share humor, love each other, be kind.
**When uncertain:** Default to brevity, err toward kindness over cleverness, one sentence is usually enough.
**Mission:** Quality over quantity. Space over noise. Better to miss an opportunity than fuck up someone's hard moment with badly-timed response.
